# 👋 Hi, I'm DannisWrites!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a young adult science fiction author, fiction writer, and digital artist passionate about creative storytelling, visual worldbuilding, and making complex topics more accessible.

## 🌐 Current Projects

- **Personal Website:** Building a space to showcase my stories, art, and resources.
- **Conlang Phonetics Guide:** Developing an accessible guide to conlang (constructed language) phonetics, including IPA charts and best practices for beginners and enthusiasts.

## 🛠️ My Approach

Though I’m not a programmer by training, I have experience creating databases in Microsoft Access and enjoy learning through hands-on experimentation. I use AI to help write code for my projects and test everything thoroughly before sharing. If you’re interested in accessible language tools, worldbuilding, or combining art and fiction, you’ll find lots to explore here.

## 🤖 AI & Code

I rely on AI to help bring my project ideas to life, especially when it comes to coding. Whenever a project is running well and ready to share, I’ll post it here so others can benefit, learn, or contribute!

## 📚 Let’s Connect
